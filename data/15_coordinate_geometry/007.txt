$A B C$ is a triangle in which $B C=7$ units, $A$ is the point $(-2, k)$ and $C$ is the point $(-5,0)$.

(a) Write down the coordinates of $B$.

(b) Given that the length of $A C$ is 5 units, find the value of $k$.

(c) Find the equation of the line $A B$.

(d) A point $D$ is such that $A D$ is parallel to the $x$-axis and $A, B, C$ and $D$ forms a trapezium of area 18 units $^2$. Find the possible coordinates of $D$.

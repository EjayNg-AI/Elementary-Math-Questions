The straight line $l_1: 2 x+2 y-10=0$ cuts the $x$-axis at $A$ and the $y$-axis $B$.

(a) Find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$.

(b) Find the length of $A B$.

(c) Find the area of triangle $O A B$.

(d) Find the perpendicular distance from $O$ to $A B$.

(e) Find the equation of another line $l_2$ which passes through the origin and is parallel to the line $l_1$.

(f) A third line, $l_3$ parallel to the $x$-axis cuts $l_1$ at the point $(k, 2)$. Find the value of $k$.

(g) Find the area bound by $l_1, l_3$, the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis.

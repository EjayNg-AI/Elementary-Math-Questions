The graph shows two straight lines $L_1$ and $L_2$. The line $L_1$ cuts the $x$-axis at $A$ and the $y$-axis at $B$. The line $L_2$ is a vertical line and it cuts the $x$-axis at $P$ and the line $L_1$ at $Q$.

(a) Find the equation of $L_1$.

(b) Find the equation of $L_2$ given that the coordinates of $P$ is $(2,0)$.

(c) Find the coordinates of $Q$.

(d) Calculate the area of triangle $O B Q$.

(e) Find the length of $B Q$.

(f) Calculate the shortest distance from $O$ to $B Q$, where $O$ is the origin.

The figure below shows a circle with centre $O$ . $P A Q$ and $S R$ are tangents to the circle at $A$ and $R$ respectively. $A C$ and $B D$ are the diameters of the circle.

(a) Show that $\triangle O A B$ is congruent to $\triangle O D C$.

(b) 

(i) Show that $\triangle O A Q$ is similar to $\triangle S R Q$.

(ii) Given that $S R=4.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $S Q=7.5 \mathrm{~cm}$, find the radius of the circle.

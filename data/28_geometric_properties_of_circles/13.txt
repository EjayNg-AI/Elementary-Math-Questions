The diagram below shows four points $A, B, C$ and $D$ on the circumference of a circle with centre $O$. $A B$ is a chord of length $8 \mathrm{~cm}$ and its perpendicular distance from $O$ is $4 \mathrm{~cm}$. $C D$ is a chord of perpendicular distance $2 \mathrm{~cm}$ from $O$. Find the

(a) radius of the circle,

(b) area of the shaded segment.

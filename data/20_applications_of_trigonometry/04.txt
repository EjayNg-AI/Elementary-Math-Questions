A cruise ship sailed from Port $A$ to Island $X$ which is $30 \mathrm{~km}$ due east of Island $Y$. Given that $\angle A X Y=50^{\circ}$ and $\angle A Y X=55^{\circ}$, calculate

(a) the bearing of $X$ from $A$,

(b) the bearing of $Y$ from $A$,

(c) the distance of $A X$,

(d) the shortest distance between Island $Y$ and the ship during its journey.

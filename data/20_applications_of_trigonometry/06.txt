In the diagram, $A, B$ and $C$ are three points on level ground. $B$ is $75 \mathrm{~m}$ from $A$, on a bearing of $060^{\circ}$. $C$ is due south of $B$ and is $90 \mathrm{~m}$ from $A$.

(a) Calculate the bearing of $A$ from $B$ and the $\angle A C B$.

(b) A tree $T$, is located $50 \mathrm{~m}$ due west of $A$. A man walks from the tree directly to $B$. How far does he walk?

(c) The man continues to walk from $B$ towards $C$ until he reaches a point $E$ where $E T$ is minimum. Find the distance of $E T$.

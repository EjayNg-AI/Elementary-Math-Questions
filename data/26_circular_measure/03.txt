The diagram shows an isosceles triangle $\triangle A B C$ in which $B C=A C=10 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $\angle B A C=0.7$ radians. $D C$ is an arc of a circle with centre $A$ and radius $A C$.

(a) Show that $\angle A C B=1.74$ radians.

(b) Find the area of the shaded region.

(c) Find the perimeter of the shaded region.

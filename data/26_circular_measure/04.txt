The figure shows two circles, with centres $O$ and $C$ and radii $8 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $r \mathrm{~cm}$, which touch externally at $P$. Given that the minor arc $A P$ is $6.8 \mathrm{~cm}, \angle B C P$ $=\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians and $A B$ is parallel to $O P C$, find

(a) $\angle A O P$ in radians and the height of the trapezium $A B C O$.

(b) Show that $r$ is approximately 6.94.

(c) Find the area of the shaded region.

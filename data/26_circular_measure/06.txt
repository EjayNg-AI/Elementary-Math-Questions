The diagram shows two circles, with centres $A$ and $B$, each of radius $5 \mathrm{~cm}$, touching each other externally at $X$. Both of them touch another bigger circle, with centre $O$ and radius $13 \mathrm{~cm}$, internally at $D$ and $C$ respectively.

(a) Show that $\angle C O D$ is 1.35 radians.

(b) Calculate

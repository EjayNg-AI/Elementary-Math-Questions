In the diagram below, $O$ is the centre of the circle with radius $4 \mathrm{~cm}$ and passing through the points $A$, $B, C$ and $D . E$ is the midpoint of $O C . A O E C$ is a straight line. $A$ is the centre of a circle through $B, E$ and $D$.

(a) Show that $\angle A O B$ is approximately $1.70 \mathrm{rad}$.

(b) Calculate

(i) the area of sector $O B C D$,

(ii) the perimeter of the shaded region,

(iii) the area of the shaded region.

The curve $y=(x+1)(3-x)$ cuts the $x$-axis at $A$ and $B$ and the $y$-axis at $C$. The line $y=2 x-1$ intersects the curve at $D$ and $E$.

(a) Write down the coordinates of $A, B$ and $C$.

(b) Write down the coordinates of the highest point on the curve.

(c) Write down the equation of the line of symmetry.

(d) Find the range of values of $x$ for which $(x+1)(3-x) \geq 2 x-1$.

(e) Write down, but do not simplify, an equation in $x$ which has the $x$-coordinates of $D$ and $E$ as its solutions.

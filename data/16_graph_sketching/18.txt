The diagram shows an empty container which is made up of two sections. The volumes of the two sections of the container are in the ratio $1: 3$. Water is poured into the empty container at a constant rate and fills it in 8 minutes. Sketch a graph showing how the depth of the water, $d \mathrm{~cm}$, in the container varies over the 8 minutes.

The diagram shows the graph of a quadratic equation $y=x^2+4 x+k$ where $k$ is a constant. Find

(a) the equation of the line of symmetry,

(b) the value of $k$,

(c) the coordinates of the points where the line $y=-12$ cuts the graph $y=x^2+4 x+k$,

(d) the value of $h$ such that $x^2+4 x+k=h$ has only 1 solution.

The diagram shows the graph of $y=x(x-1)(x-3)$ and the line $y=2 x-4$. The curve cuts the $x$-axis at the points $A, B$ and $C$.

(a) Write down the coordinates of $A, B$ and $C$.

(b) The point $(5, p)$ lies on the curve. Find the value of $p$.

(c) Write down and simplify the cubic equation which is satisfied by the values of $x$ at the points where the two graphs meet.

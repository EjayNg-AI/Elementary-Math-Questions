The diagram shows the line $O Q$, and the graphs of $y=x+2$ and $y=a x^2$. The line $y=x+2$ intersects the curve $y=a x^2$ at $P(4, p)$. $Q$ is a point on the curve vertically above point $R$ such that the line segment $P Q$ is parallel to the $x$-axis. $S$ is the point of intersection of the two lines.

Dennis and Marc took part in a $58 \mathrm{~km}$ cycling race.

(a) Dennis cycled at an average speed of $x \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$. Write down in terms of $x$, an expression for the number of hours he took to complete the race.

(b) Marc cycled at an average speed which was $3 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ greater than Marc's speed. Write down in terms of $x$, an expression for the number of hours he took to complete the race.

(c) Given that Marc completed the race $1 \frac{1}{2}$ hours earlier than Dennis, form an equation in $x$ and show that it reduces to $x^2+3 x-116=0$.

(d) Solve this equation and hence find the time Marc took to complete the race, giving your answer in hours and minutes.

A piece of wire of length $80 \mathrm{~cm}$ is cut into two parts. One part, $4 x \mathrm{~cm}$ long, is bent to form a square and the other part is bent into a circle.

(a) Write an expression for

(i) the length of the part that is bent into a circle,

(ii) the area of the square formed,

(iii) the area of the circle formed.

(b) If the area of the square is equal to the area of the circle,

(i) form an equation in $x$ and show that it reduces to $(\pi-4) x^2+160 x-1600=0$,

(ii) solve for $x$, giving your answer correct to 2 decimal places.

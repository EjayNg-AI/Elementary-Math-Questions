(a) Write down the coordinates of $R$.

(b) Given that the point $P(-1, k)$ lies on the curve, find the value of $k$.

(c) Find the equation of the line of symmetry of the curve. Hence write down the coordinates of the maximum point $M$.

(d) The line $y=m x$ cuts the curve at the origin and at point $Q(3, p)$. Find the value of $p$ and of $m$.

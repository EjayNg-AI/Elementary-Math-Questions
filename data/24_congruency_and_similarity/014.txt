A piece of solid cone is cut into a smaller piece of cone and a frustum as shown in the diagram. Given that the height of the frustum is $8 \mathrm{~mm}$ and the two circular base areas are $9 \mathrm{~mm}^2$ and $25 \mathrm{~mm}^2$ respectively,

(a) Show that the height of the smaller cone is $12 \mathrm{~mm}$.

(b) Find the volume of the frustum.

(c) Find the curved surface area of the smaller cone.

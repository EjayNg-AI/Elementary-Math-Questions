Two bottles of cooking oil are geometrically similar. Their heights are $18 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $24 \mathrm{~cm}$ respectively.

(a) Find the ratio of the circumference of the base of the smaller bottle to the circumference of the base of the larger bottle.

(b) Given that the surface area of the smaller bottle is $855 \mathrm{~cm}^2$, find the surface area of larger bottle.

(c) If the cost of the smaller bottle of cooking oil is $\$ 6.75$ and the bigger bottle is $\$ 14.80$, which bottle of cooking oil is a better buy?

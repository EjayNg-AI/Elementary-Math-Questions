The diagram shows a solid cone $W$ which is cut into 3 parts of equal thickness, $X$, $Y$ and $Z$

(a) Find the value of $\frac{\text { volume of } X}{\text { volume of } W}$ and $\frac{\text { volume of } X}{\text { volume of } Z}$.

(b) If the mass of $X$ is $250 \mathrm{~g}$, find the mass of $Y$.

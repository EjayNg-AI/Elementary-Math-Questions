In the diagram, $A B$ is parallel to $C D$ and $A D$ is parallel to $Y Z$. $A X=Y Z$ and $B C=3 B X$.

(a) Show that triangles $A X B$ and $D X C$ are similar.

(b) Name two triangles that are congruent.

(c) Find the numerical value of $\frac{A B}{D C}$ and $\frac{\text { area of } \triangle A X B}{\text { area of } \triangle D X C}$.

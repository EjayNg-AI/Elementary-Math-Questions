Fig. 1 shows the distance-time graph of an object $A$ and Fig. 2 shows the speed-time graph of an object $B$ for the first 20 seconds of their journey.

(a) State the acceleration of object $A$.

(b) Calculate the speed of object $B$ after 3 seconds.

(c) On Fig. 2, draw the speed-time graph of object $A$.

(d) Given that both objects start travelling at the same time on the same route, calculate the time taken by object $B$ to overtake object $A$.

(e) Sketch the distance-time graph of object $B$ for the first 20 seconds of its journey.

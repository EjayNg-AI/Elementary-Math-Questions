The diagram below shows a speed-time graph of a moving particle over a period of $t$ seconds.

(a) Calculate the deceleration during the first 3 seconds.

(b) Calculate the value of $t$ if the total distance moved for $t$ seconds is $63 \mathrm{~m}$.

(c) Find the speed of the particle when $t=2.5$.

(d) Sketch the distance-time graph of the particle over the period of $t$ seconds.

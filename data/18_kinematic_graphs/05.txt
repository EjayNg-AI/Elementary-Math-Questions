The graph below shows the speed of Lydia's and Wayne's remote-controlled toy cars.

(a) Calculate the acceleration of Lydia's toy car.

(b) Find the speed of Lydia's toy car at $t=8$.

(c) Lydia's toy car and Wayne's toy car start from the same point at the same time and travel in the same direction. After $T \mathrm{~s}$, Lydia's toy car has travelled the same distance as Wayne's toy car. Find the value of $T$.

(d) Sketch the distance-time graph and the acceleration-time graph for Lydia's toy car for $0 \leqslant t \leqslant T$.

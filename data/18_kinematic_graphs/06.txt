The diagram below shows the speed-time graph of an object which starts from rest.

(a) Find the speed of the object at 7 seconds.

(b) Find the value of $v$, if the total distance travelled in the first 30 seconds is $695 \mathrm{~m}$.

(c) Given that the object decelerates at $4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$, find $t$, the total time taken for the journey.

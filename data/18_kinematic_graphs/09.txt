The graph shows the speed of a car and a van at time $t$ minutes, for $0 \leqslant t \leqslant 12$. The car is travelling at a constant speed of $0.4 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{min}$ for 4 minutes before accelerating uniformly to a speed of $1 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{min}$ in the next 6 minutes. It then continues with the same speed for the next 2 minutes. Calculate

(a) the acceleration of the car at $t=8$,

(b) the average speed of the car in $\mathrm{km} / \mathrm{min}$ for the first 12 minutes.

The van starts at $t=2$ from the same starting point as the car and travels in the same direction as the car with a constant acceleration.

(c) How far apart are the car and the van when $t=12$ ?

(d) At $t=12$, the car starts to decelerate uniformly where the magnitude of the deceleration is double that of the acceleration of the van. Find the time when the car comes to rest.

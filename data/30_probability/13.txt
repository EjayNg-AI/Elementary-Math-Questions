In a bag containing $n$ balls, there are 15 red balls and the rest are blue balls. Two balls are selected from the bag at random, without replacement.

(a) Draw a tree diagram with probabilities indicated.

(b) The probability that two blue balls are selected is $\frac{3}{23}$. Write down an equation to represent this information and show that it simplifies to $2 n^2-71 n+552=0$.

(c) Solve the equation $2 n^2-71 n+552=0$. Explain why one of the solutions will be rejected.

(d) Find the probability that both balls are different in colour.

(e) A third ball is selected. Find the probability that at least one of the balls selected is red.

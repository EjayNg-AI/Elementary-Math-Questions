A Mathematics quiz is set every week. William takes the test each week until he passes. Each time he takes the test, the probability that he passes is $\frac{1}{5}$.

(a) Expressing your answers as fractions, find the probability that William

(i) fails the first test and passes the second test,

(ii) passes the test in either the first or second week,

(iii) fails the first three tests.

(b) 

(i) Find the probability, in terms of $n$, that William fails the first $n$ tests.

(ii) Write down the probability, in terms of $n$, that William passes the test in one of the first $n$ weeks.

A sentence in a page of a storybook has 25 words in it. The number of letters in each word is counted and shown in the frequency distribution table below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Number of letters & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
\hline Frequency & 1 & 3 & 6 & 4 & 5 & 4 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

(a) A word is chosen at random from the whole sentence. Find the probability that it has 5 letters.

(b) A word is chosen at random from those with an odd number of letters. Find the probability that it has 3 letters.

(c) Bob chose a word at random from the whole sentence. Charlie then chose a word at random from the whole sentence. Find the probability that one of them chose a four-lettered word and the other chose a five-lettered word.

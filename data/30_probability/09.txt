A bag contains 3 pink balls and 9 blue balls. A ball is drawn at random. If it is pink, it is replaced in the bag; if it is blue, it is not replaced in the bag. Regardless of the colour of the first ball drawn, a second ball is then drawn.

(a) Draw the tree diagram.

(b) Hence, or otherwise, find the probability that the second ball drawn is pink.

(c) Hence, or otherwise, find the probability that at least one ball drawn is blue.

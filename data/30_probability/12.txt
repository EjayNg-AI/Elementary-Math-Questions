A magician randomly draws 2 cards from a stack of 5 cards labelled 5 to 9 , one after another without replacement. The sum of the numbers on the two cards is obtained.

(a) Complete the following possibility diagram.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline+ & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline 5 & & 11 & & & \\
\hline 6 & 11 & & & & \\
\hline 7 & & & & & \\
\hline 8 & & & & & \\
\hline 9 & & & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

(b) Calculate the probability that the sum obtained is not a multiple of 5 .

A third card is chosen at random from the stack without replacement.

(c) Find the probability that the sum of the numbers on the three cards is 24.

There are $r$ red balls and 6 blue balls in a container. The probability of picking a blue ball is $\frac{2}{5}$.

(a) Show that $r=9$.

(b) Two balls are selected at random, one after another without replacement. Draw a tree diagram with probabilities indicated, and hence, find the probability that the two balls selected are of the same colour.
